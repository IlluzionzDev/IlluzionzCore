# IlluzionzCore

IlluzionzCore is a library used for utils and easy programming of Spigot Plugins. It comes with classes and implementations to code plugins flawlessly. Currently, there aren't many docs as this library is private to Illuzionz Studios ©

## Usage

To start using, create a new maven project. Make sure to initialize git and then run this command.

```
git submodule add https://github.com/IlluzionzDev/IlluzionzCore common
```
This will add the library into the /common folder in the project root. From here you can edit the code and make any changes.

Should you make any changes to the library, commit your changes with a descriptive message of what you changed, then push. This will update the library so anyone else using it will have the latest changes.

Please make sure to run
```
git pull
```
before building anything. This will ensure you have the latest version. The reason we do it this way is so the code can be easily changed and gone over when using the library.
